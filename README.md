I found that this project had me struggling like no other. However, I feel like I got further than I thought I would, and by the end I feel like the only thing that was really stopping me was the time constraint. I got some tough features in it, and I'm happy with as far as I could get, I will definetly go back to this and get it done when I get the chance.
